      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      
      <section class="prose">
        <h2>A Vision for Restoration</h2>
        <p>The Nysa project began with a simple vision: to restore the ancient vineyards of Commandaria, a region with over 2,000 years of winemaking heritage. Named after the mythical land of Nysa—home to Dionysus in Greek mythology—our project combines ancient wisdom with modern conservation science.</p>

        <h2>The Commandaria Region</h2>
        <p>Located in the heart of Cyprus, Commandaria represents one of the world's oldest designated wine regions. For millennia, communities have cultivated native grape varieties on steep, sun-exposed terraces carved into limestone hillsides. These terraces are not merely agricultural infrastructure—they are architectural heritage, ecological systems, and cultural monuments all in one.</p>

        <h2>Why Restoration Matters</h2>
        <p>Over recent decades, many vineyard terraces fell into disrepair due to modernization, economic pressures, and urbanization. The traditional knowledge of viticulture was gradually lost as younger generations moved away from agricultural life. This represented more than agricultural decline—it was the loss of cultural identity, ecological stewardship, and a connection to ancestry.</p>

        <p>The Nysa project works to reverse this trend by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rebuilding terraces:</strong> Using traditional dry-stone construction methods to restore the landscape</li>
          <li><strong>Replanting heritage varieties:</strong> Focusing on native Commandaria grapes adapted to the Mediterranean climate</li>
          <li><strong>Preserving knowledge:</strong> Engaging local experts and community members in the restoration process</li>
          <li><strong>Creating opportunity:</strong> Providing employment and skills training in agricultural heritage sectors</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Community</h2>
        <p>The Nysa project is powered by a diverse community: local villagers connected to the land and its traditions, international volunteers passionate about heritage preservation, environmental scientists studying sustainable practices, and wine enthusiasts who understand the cultural significance of Commandaria wine.</p>

        <p>Together, we're proving that heritage conservation and community resilience aren't at odds with modern sustainability goals—they're essential to achieving them.</p>

        <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
        <p>Our mission extends beyond wine production. We're working to restore an entire ecosystem—the vineyards, the terraces, the traditional knowledge, the community connections, and the environmental health of the Commandaria region. Every stone we rebuild, every vine we plant, and every volunteer who joins us is a step toward a more sustainable and culturally vibrant Mediterranean future.</p>

        <p>You're invited to be part of this restoration. Whether through direct participation, financial support, or simply by learning about our work, you can contribute to preserving something truly meaningful.</p>
